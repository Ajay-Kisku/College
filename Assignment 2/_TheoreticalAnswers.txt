1. What is a function calling and its use.
Function calling is a method to use the defined body of the function and this is its use. It can have a retun value;
It is done like "nameOfTheFunction(any-data-type variableName, any-data-type anotherVariableIfYouhave, any-data-type passingArray[], any-data-type *forCallingByReference);".

2. What is argument passing and its types and also discuss the difference between each type.
Argument passing is done according to the parameters set for a function like if we have given a certain data-type for parameters we have to keep it in mind while calling the function with same data-type of argument and number of parameters should be equal to the number of parameters.

3. What is an array, its decleration, initilization and its advatages and disadvatages in programming.
An array is a derived data-type which is used to store the data of similar type.
Ex : char names[][51] = {"Ajay", "Vijay", "Santi", "Rocky", "Reena", "Adheera", };

decleration   - int array[3];
initilization - int array[] = {1,2,3}; 
array[0] = 1;
array[1] = 2;
array[2] = 3;

advatages - 1. It confirms for similar data-type (less prone to error with data-type)
            2. It has a contigious memory storage ( easy to get/access the elements )
            3. 
            4. 

disadvatages -  1. It can't hold multiple elements of different data-types.
                2. 
                3. 
                4. 

4. Difference between 1D and 2D arrays.
1D arrays have direct elements and 2D arrays have 1D arrays inside as elements and then real elements are inside those 1D arrays.

1D array has one subscript variable on the other hand 2D have two subscript variables.

5. What is structure and its uses.
A structure is a derived data-type. It has a keyword stuct. 

With its help we can create a data-type holding bunch of other data-types inside it.
It can be used to store the data of students, employees, stafs, details of a car etc.

Ex. : 

decleration - 
struct student{
    char *name;
    int class;
    int rollNo;

}

initilization - 
struct student Rocky;
Rocky.name = "Rocking Star Yash";
Rocky.class = 12;
Rocky.rollNo = 144;
